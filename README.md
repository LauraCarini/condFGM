# conditional_neurofgm
This repository provides code and computational templates to implement and run the conditional functional graphical model (cFGM) algorithm for applications in neuroscience.

#### Computational templates
Scripts for running the cFGM algorithm both sequentially and in parallel.
Refer to the folder README for a step-by-step walkthrough of the workflow.


#### Simulation studies
Include the code to run the paper simulations, the comparison with other models proposed in "Zhao, B., Zhai, P. S., Wang, Y. S., & Kolar, M. (2024). High-dimensional functional graphical model structure learning via neighborhood selection approach. Electronic Journal of Statistics, 18(1), 1042-1129" and reproduce the simulations figures.
